# 🌐 HTML & CSS Practice Projects

This repository contains small, focused HTML and CSS exercises that explore the core building blocks of the web. It's a personal learning space to build up foundational frontend skills, one concept at a time.

## ✅ What I've Built So Far

- 🎧 **Audio elements**  
  Learned how to embed and control sound in web pages using the `<audio>` tag.

- 🔘 **Buttons**  
  Experimented with different types of buttons using `<button>` and `<input type="button">`, and styled them with CSS.

- 📝 **Forms**  
  Practiced creating forms with labels, input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons.

- 🖼️ **Images**  
  Used the `<img>` tag to display and resize images, and added `alt` attributes for accessibility.

- 🔲 **Span & Div elements**  
  Explored how `<span>` and `<div>` are used for structure and styling, and the difference between inline and block elements.

- 📊 **Tables**  
  Built basic HTML tables with `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` for displaying structured data.

- 🎨 **Mini Styled Project**  
  Created a simple CSS-styled landing page that links to helpful HTML & CSS tutorials — kind of like a mini "learn web dev" hub!
